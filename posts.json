        "content": "<p>Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. This guide will walk you through setting up your first Flask project, defining your first route, and understanding the core concepts of Flask.</p><h3>Installation</h3><p>First, ensure you have Python installed. Then, you can install Flask using pip:</p><pre><code>pip install Flask</code></pre><h3>Your First App</h3><p>Create a file named <code>app.py</code>:</p><pre><code>from flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello_world():\n    return 'Hello, World!'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)</code></pre><p>This simple code creates a Flask application, defines a route for the home page, and runs the development server.</p>"

        "content": "<p>CSS animations are a powerful tool for enhancing user experience and adding a touch of dynamism to your web projects. They allow you to animate changes in CSS properties smoothly over a specified duration, bringing your designs to life without relying solely on JavaScript.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p>The two main pillars of CSS animations are <code>transitions</code> and <code>keyframes</code>.</p><h4>Transitions</h4><p>Transitions provide a way to animate changes in CSS properties smoothly over a specified duration. For example, changing a button's background color on hover:</p><pre><code>.button {\n    background-color: blue;\n    transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n.button:hover {\n    background-color: darkblue;\n}</code></pre><h4>Keyframes</h4><p><code>@keyframes</code> rules define the animation sequence by specifying styles at different points during the animation. You can define specific stages of an animation:</p><pre><code>@keyframes slideIn {\n    0% { transform: translateY(100%); opacity: 0; }\n    100% { transform: translateY(0); opacity: 1; }\n}</code></pre><p>This allows for more complex, multi-stage animations beyond simple property changes.</p>"

        "content": "<p>Asynchronous operations are fundamental to modern web development, allowing non-blocking execution for tasks like fetching data from an API. Traditionally, this was handled with callbacks and Promises, but ES2017 introduced <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> as syntactic sugar to make asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, greatly improving readability.</p><h3>The Problem with Callbacks</h3><p>Before Promises and async/await, deeply nested callbacks (often called 'callback hell') made complex asynchronous flows hard to manage.</p><h3>Promises to the Rescue</h3><p>Promises offered a better way, providing a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations with <code>.then()</code> and <code>.catch()</code>.</p><h3>Async/Await: The Modern Approach</h3><p><code>async</code> and <code>await</code> build on Promises, making asynchronous code even more intuitive. An <code>async</code> function is a function declared with the <code>async</code> keyword, and the <code>await</code> keyword can be used inside <code>async</code> functions to pause execution until a Promise settles (resolves or rejects).</p><pre><code>async function fetchData() {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n        const data = await response.json();\n        console.log(data);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);\n    }\n}</code></pre><p>This structure significantly improves error handling and makes the sequence of asynchronous operations much clearer.</p>"
